# Stock-Diary

This application is something I developed from scratch and is currently unfinished.

As of now, users can search for a stock on the stock market and certain information regarding that stock will be shown in a table format with a brief description of the company.

The financial information has been pulled through the Alpha Vantage API.

I used Pyhon and Flask to develop this application.

# TODO
Finish login system, display top 20 Strong Buy stocks & add portfolio/diary section where you can save stocks and add notes.
